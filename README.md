Dynamic Hiearchy Macro
=======================

A hierarchy Macro using jQuery and jsTree (http://www.jstree.com) to display dynamic tree view of wiki documents based on parent/child relationships.

Similar to http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/HierarchyMacro but doesn't load all elements at once, instead they are loaded dynamically when nodes are expanded.
